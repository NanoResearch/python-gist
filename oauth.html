<p>Please copy and paste the following code into the python-gists window that you probably have open: <div id="code">code should be here.</div></p>
<p>If there's no code there, something's gone wrong with my javascript. Either take the value after ?code= in the URL in your address bar, or try the manual method in python-gists (requires GitHub username &amp; password)</p>
