python-gists
============

A command line python gist-posting app. Very much a work in progress


Todo
============
* Posting gists
    * Posting a new revision of a gist
* Editing gists
* Deleting gists
* Listing gists

* Getting an OAuth token using a username and password first - more console friendly
* Reading gist from stdin
